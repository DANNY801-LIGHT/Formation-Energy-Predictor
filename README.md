##  Formation Energy Predictor

**FormationEnergyPredictor** is a machine learning web application that predicts the **formation energy (eV/atom)** of perovskite-based materials using their atomic and physical properties. It also classifies the material as **Stable**, **Metastable**, or **Unstable**, helping materials scientists rapidly screen novel compositions for energy, electronics, and photovoltaic applications.

## ðŸ”¬ What It Does

* Takes in a materialâ€™s **A site**, **B site**, and **X site** elements and a few physical properties
* Predicts the **formation energy** using a trained machine learning model
* Classifies material stability:

  * ðŸŸ¢ Stable (low/negative formation energy)
  * ðŸŸ¡ Metastable (near-zero formation energy)
  * ðŸ”´ Unstable (positive formation energy)
* Visualizes the result on a stability scale

## How It Was Built

This project was built using:

* **Python & Scikit-learn**: for training a Gradient Boosting model
* **Gradio**: for building the web interface
* **Matplotlib**: to visualize formation energy in a stability chart
* **Hugging Face Spaces**: to host the application online

### ðŸ”§ Workflow

1. **Data Source**: A curated dataset of perovskite materials with elemental properties and formation energies.
2. **Feature Engineering**:

   * Selected top features including:

     * `A site #1`, `B site #1`, `X site`
     * `Number of elements`
     * `Density_AB_avg`
     * `Ionization Energy_AB_avg`
     * `Atomic Volume_AB_avg`
3. **Modeling**:

   * Used `GradientBoostingRegressor` inside a preprocessing pipeline
   * Trained with 80/20 train-test split and achieved a good RÂ² score
4. **Deployment**:

   * Packaged with `gradio` and deployed to Hugging Face using `requirements.txt`

##  Use Case & Problem Solved

### Challenge:

In materials science, **discovering new stable compounds** is time-consuming and expensive. Researchers often simulate or synthesize hundreds of compositions before finding one that works.

### This app solves:

* Fast **pre-screening** of candidate perovskite materials
* Prediction of **stability** before physical experiments or simulations
* Reduction in **cost and time** spent on unstable materials
* Supports **green energy** and **optoelectronic research**

## Key Feature Insights

From the trained model, these features were found most important:

* **Ionization Energy** â€” higher values lead to instability
* **Density and Atomic Volume** â€” influence bonding compactness
* **A, B, X site identity** â€” define lattice behavior in perovskites

---

## Future Improvements

* Add support for ABXâ‚‚ and double perovskite structures
* Enable batch predictions via file upload
* Integrate SHAP or permutation importance plots for full explainability
* Add default dropdown menus and example presets
